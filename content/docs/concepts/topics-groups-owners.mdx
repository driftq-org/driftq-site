description: The core consumer model behind DriftQ-Core.

## Topics

A **topic** is a named stream of messages. Topics can have partitions.

## Consumer groups

A **group** is a logical subscription. Each group maintains its own committed offset per partition.

That means:

- Group **g1** and **g2** can independently consume the same topic.
- Each group sees the stream from its own position.

## Owners

An **owner** identifies a consumer instance. DriftQ uses `owner` to enforce safe ack/nack behavior.

- `/v1/consume` requires `owner`
- `/v1/ack` and `/v1/nack` require the same `owner`
- If the owner doesn’t match who currently holds the message lease, you get a conflict response.
