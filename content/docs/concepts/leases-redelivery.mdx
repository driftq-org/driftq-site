title: Leases & Redelivery
description: How DriftQ prevents stuck messages and safely re-delivers work.
---

When a consumer receives a message, DriftQ considers it **in-flight** for that owner.

A lease duration comes from:

- `lease_ms` on `/v1/consume` if provided, otherwise
- the broker's default ack timeout

If a message isn't acked before the lease expires, DriftQ schedules redelivery and increments `attempts`.
