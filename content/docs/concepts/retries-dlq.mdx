title: Retries & DLQ
description: Retry policy, backoff, and strict dead-letter routing.

Retry policy is carried in the envelope. In `/v1/produce`, pass query params like:

- `retry_max_attempts`
- `retry_backoff_ms`
- `retry_max_backoff_ms`

When `attempts` reaches `max_attempts`, DriftQ routes the message to a DLQ and increments `dlq_messages_total{reason=...}`.
