title: Message Envelope
description: Metadata carried with messages for AI workflows.

A message can carry an **envelope** with fields like:

- `tenant_id`
- `idempotency_key`
- `deadline`
- `retry_policy` (max attempts + backoff)

This envelope is where DriftQ grows into a workflow engine (v2), because it provides “control plane” metadata for routing, retries, budgets, and tracing.
