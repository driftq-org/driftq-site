Welcome to the DriftQ-Core docs.

DriftQ-Core is a lightweight broker built for **AI workflow reliability**:

- Streaming consume (NDJSON) with **owner + lease**
- **Ack / Nack** with ownership enforcement
- Retry policy (max attempts + backoff) + strict **DLQ routing**
- Consume-scope **idempotency keys** to prevent duplicate side effects
- Prometheus metrics (inflight, lag, DLQ totals, producer backpressure)

If you want to get running fast, go straight to **[Quickstart](/docs/quickstart)**.
